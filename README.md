In this program we check whether a users command line argument is valid or invalid by multiplying 
each number in an even index position by 2 and adding it into sum2, and adding each number in an odd 
position into sum1. At the end we add together sum1 and sum2 to create finalSum. To check for validation 
we see if finalSum is divisible by 10, if so, it is valid. Otherwise it is invalid.
